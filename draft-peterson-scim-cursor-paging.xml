        The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol supports
        the retrieval of core identity resources such as users and groups.
        In order to avoid overwhelming the SCIM client or service provider,
        SCIM defines index and count pagination query parameters that can
        be used "page through" large numbers of resources. For some SCIM
        service providers there are advantages in implementing cursor-based
        pagination as an alternative to index-based pagination. This document
        defines a simple extension to the SCIM protocol and core schema
        to assure interoperability of SCIM implementations that need to
        realize the advantages cursor-based pagination.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC7644">System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol</xref>
        supports the retrieval of core identity resources such as users
        and groups. When many resources exist, two strategies may be employed
        to help to avoid overwhelming the SCIM client and service provider.
        First, SCIM supports the use of query filters. A query filter allows
        the SCIM client to constrain the results returned to just the subset
        of resources that are needed by the client. Second, SCIM supports
        the ability to "page through" large result sets using index/count
        pagination parameters.
      </t>

      <t>Not only is filtering an OPTIONAL capability,for service providers,
        it is also a very common for SCIM clients to not to use a query
        filter in order to intentionally to retrieve all resources. Therefore,
        pagination of results (more so than filtering) is a primary scalability
        mechanism for SCIM service providers.
      </t>

      <t>The two most common patterns for result pagination in HTTP-based
        protocols are: index-based pagination, and cursor-based pagination.
        Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. For web applications
        that also provide a application-specific Web API, the decision
        for which result pagination approach to use in the Web API is often
        dictated by the capabilities and optimizations of the underlying
        application database technology, or by strongly held preference
        of software developers.
      </t>

      <t>
        Implementation of a SCIM service provider is often made as a companion
        service along side an already existing application-specific Web
        API. If cusor-based pagination is already used in an existing application,
        it can be difficult to create a companion SCIM implementation that
        uses existing application code paths. For these applications, the
        mismatch in pagination approaches (index-based vs. cursor-based)
        is an impediment to SCIM implementation.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document defines a simple extension to the SCIM protocol and core
        schema that adds support for cursor-based pagination. Support for
        cursor-based pagination in SCIM encourages broader cross-application
        identity management interoperiablity by encouraging SCIM implementations
        for applications where cursor-based pagination is preferred.

    <section title="Query Parameters and Response Attributes">
      <t>The following table describes the URL pagination parameters for cursor-based
        pagination:
      </t>

      <texttable anchor="parameters" title="Pagination Request Parameters">
        <ttcol align="left">Parameter</ttcol>
        <ttcol align="left">Description</ttcol>
        <ttcol align="left">Default</ttcol>

        <c>cursor</c>
        <c>The string value from the nextCursor attribute from the previous
          result page. A cursor parameter SHOULD be omitted for the first
          request of paginated query</c>
        <c>None.</c>

        <c>count</c>
        <c>A positive integer. Specifies the desired maximum number of query
          results per page, e.g., 10.</c>
        <c>None. When specified, the service provider MUST NOT return more
          results than specified, although it MAY return fewer results.</c>
      </texttable>

      <t>
        The following table describes cursor-based pagination attributes returned
        in a paged query response:
      </t>

      <texttable anchor="attributes" title="Pagination Response Elements">
        <ttcol align="left">Element</ttcol>
        <ttcol align="left">Description</ttcol>

        <c>nextCursor</c>
        <c>A cursor value string that MAY be used in a subsequent request
          to obtain the next page of results. Service providers supporting
          cursor-based pagination MUST include nextCursor in all paged query responses
          except when returning the last page.  nextCursor is omitted from
          a response only to indicate that there are no more result pages.</c>

        <c>previousCursor</c>
        <c>A cursor value string that MAY be used in a subsequent request
          to obtain the previous page of results.  Use of previousCursor is
          optional.  Service Providers that are unable to support a previousCursor
          MAY omit previousCursor when sending paged query responses.</c>

      </texttable>

      <t>
        For example, to retrieve the first 10 Users, omit the cursor and set the
        count to 10:
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[
   GET /Users?count=10
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD
]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        The response to the query above returns metadata regarding pagination similar
        to the following example (actual resources removed for brevity):
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[
   {
       "totalResults":100,
       "nextCursor":"VZUTiyhEQJ94IR",
       "schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
       "Resources":[{
        ...
       }]
   }
]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        Given the example above, to continue pagination, set the cursor to the
        value of nextCursor ("VZUTiyhEQJ94IR") and re-fetch:
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[
   GET /Users?cursor=VZUTiyhEQJ94I&count=10
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD
]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>If a Service Provider encounters an invalid cursor or count value (or 
      other error condition), the Service Provider SHOULD return appropriate
      HTTP response status code and JSON detail error response as defined in 
      Section 3.1.2 of <xref target="RFC7644">RFC 7644</xref>      
      </t>

    <section title="Service Provider Configuration">

      <t>
        T
        <xref target="RFC7644">The SCIM service provider configuration resource</xref> facilitates
        discovery of SCIM service provider features. A SCIM Service provider
        implementing cursor-based pagination SHOULD include the following
        additional attribute in JSON document returned by the /ServiceProviderConfig
        endpoint:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText='pagination:'>
            A complex type that indicates cursor-based pagination configuration options.
            OPTIONAL.
          </t>
          <t>cursor A Boolean value specifying whether or not the cursor-based
            pagination is supported. REQUIRED.
          </t>          
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Before using cursor-based pagination, a SCIM client SHOULD fetch the Service
        Provider Configuration document from the SCIM service provider
        and verify that cursor-based pagination is supported.
      </t>

      <t>
        For example:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[
   GET /ServiceProviderConfig
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        A service provider supporting cursor-based pagination would return a document
        similar to the following (portions of full Service Provider Configuration
        Schema ommitted for brevity):
      </t>
